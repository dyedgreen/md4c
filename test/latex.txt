With the flag `MD_FLAG_LATEXMATHSPANS`, MD4C enables extension for recognition
of LaTeX style equation spans.

An equation is is any text wrapped in tildes ($ or $$).

```````````````````````````````` example
$a+b=c$ Hello, world!
.
<p><equation>a+b=c</equation> Hello, world!</p>
````````````````````````````````

If a double dollar sign is used, the equation is a display equation.

```````````````````````````````` example
This is a display equation: $$\int_a^b x dx$$.
.
<p>This is a display equation: <equation type="display">\int_a^b x dx</equation>.</p>
````````````````````````````````

Equations may span multiple lines.

```````````````````````````````` example
$$
\int_a^b f(x) dx
$$
<p><equation type="display">\int_a^b f(x) dx </equation></p>
````````````````````````````````
